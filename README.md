Project Digit Recognition.
I'm training a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
You can execute the program and draw your own digit. The network makes a prediction and tells you what digit you drew.
As training data I'm using the MNIST database which can be found here: "http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/".
